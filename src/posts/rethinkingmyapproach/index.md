## A Change in Scope

I am currently in an odd limbo with regards to my developing career. I set out around 5 years ago on a journey to formally start a shift in career. I am in a very fortunate position to be employed in a position which allows me a lot of free time to study and pursue this direction, and have been making steady process during that time. I worked my way through several courses, starting with the Harvard CS50 online course (highly recommended), worked through The Odin Project (another great resource) and finally started a Masters in Computer Science at the University of Bath. During all this time my journey has been motivated by a love of programming, coding and building more than any financial or practical necessities.
More recently, me and my wife welcome our daughter into the world. It has been an amazing, yet challenging journey, and has allowed me to put a few things into perspective. For a start, I am more carefully considering any drastic career moves that might put my time or financial freedom in jeapordy. While I am still determined to pursue a career in developing, I have reframed my journey a little and have started rethinking about my approach to this career change. What I mean is, there were quite a few areas in which I had an interest, but due to my career search I prioritised skills which would be immediately transferable to development jobs I could see around me. I focused on learning backend skills and working with frameworks like React for creating web applications.
With this new perspective, I would like to spend a little time going back to basics, taking a deep dive in some areas
which I had put on the back burner, and maybe trying some projects which I got excited about, but shelved due to it not
being marketable to employers. 

## C

The first thing I really wanted to do is get more to grips with C as a language. I had always been interested in
learning C for getting a little closer to the machine, but it just didn't align with my trajectory towards getting
hired. Now, however, I kind of think that that was the wrong way to think about it, afterall, learning more about low
level programming cannot possibly hurt my skills as a developer. I purchased the C Programming Language Book and worked
my way through it. I already had some experience with it from university, but this was mainly to teach myself
programming fundamentals: variables, loops, if statements and the like. It was time to learn about pointers and memory
management and start making some small programs in C.
So far I am enjoying it, I have a few projects that I want to try out to get me used to it, but it has been a refreshing
change learning something completely new, and maybe it will eventually steer me to something that I get really involved
in.

## Doom

On a side note, I read another book recently which I would recommend to anyone with an interest in the history of
computer games. Masters of Doom was a history of id software and the development of their landmark games including
Wolfenstein 3-D, Doom and Quake. It was a really engaging read, and very inspiring for me in particular. Over 20 years
ago I had my first experience with computer programming when I got gifted the DarkBASIC game creation tool which I
explored with my Dad. I had always been making pen and paper games, and my Dad had even showed me how I could make a
'Choose you own...' style game using Powerpoint, so that felt like the next step. Making games had always been the dream
job for me, and every now and then I think about it again and wonder what it would be like, but I am always reticent to
start on anything due to the stories I have heard about how taxing game development is. Reading this book reignited a
little bit of that spark in me, and I am wondering if my exploring new types of programming might be a good way for me
to flirt with making games again, not for profit, but more for spiritual nourishment. I am starting to become more
open-minded about it.
